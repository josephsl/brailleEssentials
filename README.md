# Braille Essentials

* Authors: Joseph Lee, Dalen

IMPORTANT: this is a fork of BrailleExtender (original author: André-Abush Clause). The rest of this document is based on BrailleExtender user guide with changes to add-on names and usage details. For a list of changes made between each Braille Essentials add-on releases, refer to [changelogs for add-on releases][1] document.

NVDA add-on that extends braille output, input, scrolling, and display-specific gestures.

## Quick start

These steps are enough for most users. You do not need custom braille tables unless you want your own table files.

1. **Install** the add-on (`.nvda-addon` file, or form the NVDA Add-on Store when it is listed there).
2. **Settings:** **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Settings…** — review the tabs you care about (for example **General**, **Braille tables**, **Document formatting**).
3. **Gestures:** **NVDA → Preferences → Input gestures → Category: Braille Essentials** — assign the commands you will use. **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Gestures for this display…** shows what your current braille display profile already defines.
4. Open **User guide** from the add-on store/menu/help if you want the same information in a separate window while you use NVDA.

**Optional features** (only when you need them): custom braille tables, table dictionaries, quick launches, advanced input mode, and more. They are **not** part of the default setup — see [Documentation in NVDA](#documentation-in-nvda) for menu paths, or the detailed sections below.

## How Braille Essentials relates to NVDA

Braille Essentials is a fork of Braille Extender (see below). It includes most of the features discussed below and shares common history and code. However, Braile Essentials is designed with more recent NVDA releases in mind, including using NVDA features such as add-on store's add-on update feature and support for document formatting tags provided by NVDA.

From Braile Extender documentation: Braille Extender used to cover a lot of ground that **NVDA did not do yet** in braille. The first public release was **August 2017**, the same week as **NVDA 2017.3**, which is the version that best matches that moment in time.

NVDA’s own **Settings → Braille** (and related panels) have since gained options many people once relied on the add-on for. Braille Essentials still adds extra behavior; check NVDA’s **release notes** if you want the exact wording for each item below.

| From NVDA | Now in NVDA core (summary) |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **2022.3** | **Interrupt speech** when scrolling the braille display. |
| **2024.2** | **`NVDA+Alt+t`** toggles **braille mode**; new **display speech output** mode (braille mirrors what NVDA speaks). |
| **2024.3** | **Unicode normalization** for speech and braille; **custom braille tables** from add-ons and NVDA’s scratchpad folder. Braille Essentials can add its own tables and use tables from other add-ons, not only NVDA’s built-in list. |
| **2024.4** | **Speak character when routing** in text; more **formatting in braille** choices (e.g. tags); **paragraph start** in braille when reading by paragraph; routing fixes. |
| **2025.1** | **Input and output tables** can follow NVDA’s **interface language**; **speak line or paragraph** when using braille **navigation** keys. |
| **2026.1** | **List item count** and **spelling and grammar errors** are reported in braille. |
| **2026.2** | **Braille auto-scroll** added, including setting **scroll rate** in percentage. |

## Settings categories (overview)

These match the tabs in **Braille Essentials settings**:

| Category | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| **General** | Speak current line while scrolling, skip blank lines, smart Caps Lock, modifier/volume feedback, two favorite displays and reload, margins, reverse scroll, tab as spaces, terminals (braille follows review), routing cursor behavior, announce character when routing (until NVDA handles it), post-output table, quick launches. |
| **Rotor** | Which rotor items exist and their order. |
| **Auto scroll** | Delays and behavior for automatic braille scrolling. |
| **Speech History Mode** | History length, numbering, optional speech while browsing history. |
| **Document formatting** | Braille mirrors/overrides for NVDA document formatting (see [Detailed topics](#document-formatting)). |
| **Object Presentation** | **Order properties** (name, state, value, role text, description, shortcuts, position, table coords, …), **selected** marking (dots 7/8 or tags), **progress bar** style, **background** progress rules. |
| **Braille tables** | Input/output table rotation lists, optional automatic tables on NVDA 2025.1+, shortcut table, table dictionaries. |
| **Undefined character representation** | How characters missing from the table appear (HUC8, numeric bases, custom patterns, descriptions). |
| **Advanced input mode** | Escape sign, exit-after-one-character, abbreviation dictionary. |
| **One-handed mode** | Enable and choose one of three one-hand input methods. |
| **Role labels** | Custom braille labels for roles, landmarks, and states. |
| **Advanced** | Compatibility toggles (cursor fixes, hide dots 7–8, foreground refresh on name changes). |

## Detailed topics

### General

- **Say current line while scrolling:** speaks the line when you pan the braille display—**focus**, **review**, **both**, or **off**. On **NVDA 2025.1+**, NVDA can also speak the line when using braille navigation keys; if you hear **double** announcements, turn off NVDA **Braille → Speak when navigating by line or paragraph** or reduce overlap here.
- **Interrupt speech while scrolling:** the add-on’s **Speech interrupt when scrolling on same line** checkbox is **disabled on NVDA 2022.3 and later**; use NVDA **Braille → Interrupt speech while scrolling** instead. On **older NVDA** you can still change the add-on checkbox.
- **Skip blank lines:** when panning by line, empty lines can be skipped.
- **Smart Caps Lock:** when this option is **on** and **Windows Caps Lock** is **on**, letters produced from the **braille keyboard** in an ordinary **text field** are **sent with swapped case** (each **A–Z** becomes the opposite case; other characters are unchanged). This only applies to normal typing, not when you are holding **modifier keys** for shortcuts. Turn it **off** if you want the braille table’s output exactly as translated, regardless of Caps Lock.
- **Modifier / volume feedback:** optional **braille**, **speech**, **both**, or **none** when modifier locks or volume change gestures are used; optional **beeps** with modifiers.
- **Two favorite displays:** pick two saved display names and use the reload gestures to **switch the active braille display** quickly.
- **Margins:** per-display **left** and **right** margin in cells (each up to **80**).
- **Reverse scroll buttons:** swaps which physical key means “scroll back” vs “scroll forward”.
- **Tabs as spaces:** show tab characters as a run of spaces; **tab width** is per display (range **1–42**).
- **Terminals (braille follows review):** when **on**, entering a **terminal** (classic console role, or **Windows Terminal**’s window) makes **braille follow the review cursor**, keeps the **review cursor aligned with the text caret**, and refreshes braille when the **caret moves**, even when NVDA would usually switch braille back to the focused control—so line-based keys act on the terminal text. When you **leave** the terminal, the add-on stops this behavior and returns to your normal NVDA braille settings. **Off** if you prefer stock NVDA behavior. **Does not apply** on the secure desktop when NVDA blocks the check, or when **braille mode** is set to follow speech output only.
- **Routing in edit fields:** **normal** passes the key to NVDA; **emulate arrows** sends Home/End or repeated Left/Right so the caret jumps to the braille cell under the router (optional **beeps**). This applies when you are on the usual braille view, the system caret has **focus**, and you are in a **terminal** or **editable text** field.
- **Announce character when routing braille cursor:** when enabled, after **routing** the add-on speaks the **character under the routing cursor** using NVDA’s speech-symbol rules. On **NVDA 2024.4+** this checkbox is **disabled** in favor of NVDA **Braille → Speak character when routing cursor in text** (same idea).
- **Speech interrupt for unknown gestures:** checkbox that is saved in your profile; the current add-on code **does not read** this setting, so changing it has **no effect** (reserved for a possible future use).
- **Post-output table:** optional second **Liblouis** pass after the usual table translation.
- **Quick launches:** map gestures to **applications** or **URLs**; entries live in the “Quick launches” dialog.
- **Unicode tools:** commands (assign in **Input gestures**) work on **selected text** in a **browse mode** document when a selection exists; if there is no selection, they use the **navigator object’s name** (the same object the **review cursor** is on—select text or move the review cursor first). They convert between **plain text and Unicode braille** (e.g. **z** ↔ **⠵** depending on table) and between **Unicode braille and dot numbers**.

### Braille tables

- **Rotation lists:** your **input** and **output** table lists are **names in order, separated by commas**. The **next/previous table** commands move through that order (assign them in **Input gestures** if your display profile does not already).
- **Automatic table row:** On **NVDA 2025.1+**, you can include **automatic** entries; the add-on resolves them with NVDA’s language-based default tables. On older NVDA, **auto** is not supported the same way—use explicit table files.
- **Shortcut input table:** optional separate table used for certain shortcuts.
- **Additional Liblouis output pass:** optional **second output table** applied after the main one (tables from your preferred output list; not inactive custom tables).
- **Tabs as spaces:** show tab characters as a run of spaces; **tab width** is per active display (range **1–42**).
- **Manage custom braille tables…:** opens the custom-tables dialog (see below).

**Table dictionaries** (not in settings tabs)

Three layers work together: **Global** (applies to all tables), **Table** (for the current **output** table), and **Temporary** (short-lived overrides until you restart NVDA). If a dictionary file has errors, that layer is skipped until you fix it.

Open **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Table dictionaries** → **Global dictionary**, **Table dictionary**, or **Temporary dictionary**.

#### Custom braille tables

Braille Essentials can **store and use your own braille tables** when you select them in the manager. They apply to braille **input** and **output** through the add-on (not through **NVDA → Settings → Braille** or the add-on’s table rotation lists).

**Requirement**: Table files must be **`.utb`**, **`.ctb`**, or **`.tbl`** (not helper files such as `.cti` or `.dis`).

**Where to open the manager**

| Location | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Custom braille tables…** | Dedicated dialog (list and all actions). |
| **Braille Essentials settings → Braille tables → Manage custom braille tables…** | Opens the same dialog. |

**What you can do**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Add…** | **Copy from an existing table** or **create an empty table** with a minimal starter rule file. The copy list includes built-in NVDA tables, other add-ons’ tables, and tables already stored by Braille Essentials. Set display name, contracted, and input/output flags in the next dialog. |
| **Remove** | Deletes metadata and the stored `.utb` / `.ctb` / `.tbl` file after confirmation. |
| **Edit…** | Opens the table file in your default editor (under the user storage folder below). |
| **Properties…** | Change display name, contracted, and whether the table is used for **input** and/or **output**. |

To **clone a custom table you already manage**, use **Add… → Copy from an existing table** and pick it from the list (same display name as in the custom-tables list).

**Add dialog**

- Choose **Copy from an existing table** (built-in, other add-ons, or your own custom tables) or **Create an empty table**.
- **Copy** keeps the source file extension (`.utb`, `.ctb`, or `.tbl`).
- **Create empty** writes a minimal starter file as **`.utb`**, or **`.ctb`** if you mark the table **contracted** in the properties step.

**Choosing which custom table to use**

At the top of the custom braille tables dialog:

| Control | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Active custom input table** | **None** (default) uses your normal NVDA input table. Pick a custom table to use it for braille input. |
| **Active custom output table** | **None** uses your normal NVDA output table. Pick a custom table to use it for braille translation. |

Only the table(s) you select here are active. They **do not** appear in **NVDA → Settings → Braille** or in Braille Essentials’ table rotation lists, so NVDA can still start normally if the add-on is not loaded.

Press **OK** to apply your choice. To stop using custom tables, set both lists to **None** (files are kept). To delete tables permanently, use **Remove** in the manager.

**Storage**

Table files and a small settings file are saved in your **NVDA user configuration folder** ( **NVDA menu → Preferences → General → Open NVDA user configuration directory** ), under **brailleExtender\customBrailleTables\**.

After you add, remove, or change tables, braille **updates immediately**.

**Using custom tables day to day**

1. Add the table (**Add… → Copy from an existing table**, or **create an empty table**).
2. In **Properties**, allow it for **input** and/or **output** (capabilities of the table file).
3. Set **Active custom input table** and/or **Active custom output table** to that table (or leave **None** for that direction).
4. Press **OK**. New tables are selected automatically for the directions you enabled when you add them.

**If you turn the add-on off**

Your custom table choice is kept in Braille Essentials’ own settings so NVDA’s braille settings stay on a safe built-in table. When you enable the add-on again, your custom selection comes back.

**Tables from other add-ons (NVDA 2024.3+)**

You do **not** need to copy a table into Braille Essentials’ folder. Tables from another add-on (for example **Experimental braille tables**) or NVDA’s scratchpad work like built-in tables: add them to your **rotation lists**, switch to them with the table commands, or use them as the **additional output pass**. On **NVDA 2024.1–2024.2**, only NVDA’s built-in tables are supported.

**If a table file is missing**

The add-on falls back to a safe table where it can and clears broken entries from your lists so braille keeps working.

### Document formatting

Braille Essentials does **not** replace NVDA’s **Document formatting** dialog. It adds a **separate braille presentation** step on top of NVDA’s choices:

- **Per-row mode:** for each report row, typically **Follow NVDA** (same toggles as NVDA Document formatting—speech **and** braille, not speech alone), **Always in braille** (force on the display, with **Methods** / **Tags** where applicable), or **Off** for that row in this layer.
- **Plain text:** show content without the usual structure chrome from this layer.
- **Line by line:** braille is built **line-at-a-time** for the reading unit.
- **Alignments:** for **left / center / right / justified**, choose **none**, **line padding** (leading blanks on the physical line), **dot 7/8/78**, **tags**, or legacy **spacing** (treated like line padding where relevant).
- **Methods:** for font-like attributes (**bold**, **italic**, **underline**, **strikethrough**, **strong**, **emphasised**, **marked**, sub/superscript, spelling/grammar flags) choose **none**, **dots 7/8**, **tags**, etc. NVDA’s own spelling/grammar attributes can still be driven by NVDA when you use **Follow NVDA** on those rows.
- **Lists:** options such as **show level** for list items.
- **Tags:** configurable **start/end** strings (defaults often `[` / `]`) for tag-style markers.
- **Report options:** a long list of choices (alignment names, colors, links, tables, line numbers, spelling, …) aligned with NVDA’s document-formatting categories—each can follow NVDA, always show in braille, or stay off.
- **Excel cell formulas:** when **on**, if a cell reports **has formula** and a formula string exists, the **formula** can be moved into the **description** field for braille so the state line is not overloaded (states are adjusted accordingly).

On **NVDA 2024.4+**, NVDA adds its own global braille formatting choices; Braille Essentials still offers this row-by-row layout, tags, padding, and methods.

### Object presentation

**Order properties**

Controls the **left-to-right sequence** of pieces on the braille line when NVDA shows a **single object’s summary** (focus/context): **state**, **table cell coordinates**, **value**, **name**, **role text**, **description**, **keyboard shortcut**, **position** (e.g. `3/10`), **outline level** (`lv n`), **current** markers (for example “current page” on the web), **placeholder**, and similar fields.

- Open **Object presentation → Order Properties…** to move lines up/down. Buttons reset to **NVDA’s default order** or the **add-on default** (add-on default puts **states** and **cell coordinates** ahead of **name** for quicker scanning).
- Only properties that **exist** for the current object are shown; empty pieces are skipped.
- **Description**, **shortcut**, **position**, and **cell coordinates** still respect NVDA’s own presentation toggles (e.g. “report descriptions”) or the add-on’s document-formatting **report** for table cell coordinates—if NVDA omits them, they are not magically recreated here.
- **Math:** if the object is **math** and NVDA can provide math braille, that content can be **added after** the usual summary.
- **Visited links:** visited state may be folded into shorter **role text** (e.g. “vlnk”) so the state list stays compact.

**Selected element marking**

How to **highlight the current selection** in braille: **none**, **dot 7**, **dot 8**, **dots 7 and 8**, or **tags**. When this is **not none** and a **name** is present, **selected** / **selectable** states are dropped from the **state** text so you do not hear redundant “selected” next to dots 7–8 marking.

**Progress bar output**

Matches the choices in **Object presentation** settings:

- **Disabled:** same idea as NVDA’s usual progress reporting.
- **Enabled, raw value:** shows the underlying value as a **temporary braille message** while the bar updates. NVDA may still **speak** progress according to its own **Progress bar updates** settings; this add-on option does not drive speech by itself.
- **Enabled, bar:** a row of **⣿** cells whose length reflects the percentage across your **display width** (very long percentage text is shortened).

**Background progress windows**

These choices work together with NVDA’s **Report background progress bars** setting: you can match NVDA, always allow background bars, or **foreground only** so braille is not filled by progress bars for windows you are not working in.

### Undefined character representation

Characters **not defined** in the active output table (including many **emoji**) use the chosen **method**: table default, full **1–8** or **1–6** dot cell, **empty**, custom **dot pattern** (`6-123456` style), **question mark**, custom **sign** (`??` style), **hex** (Liblouis, **HUC8**, **HUC6**), **decimal**, **octal**, **binary**.

**Descriptions:** optional character **description**, **extended** description, **full extended**, optional **size** line, optional **Unicode data** as a last resort, and an **exclude** list (character codes or ranges) so description is skipped for ranges you find noisy.

**Precedence:** table rules and **table dictionaries** take priority over descriptions; descriptions take priority over the generic undefined pattern.

More on **HUC**: [danielmayr.at/huc](https://danielmayr.at/huc/)

### Advanced input mode

Toggle **advanced input** (defaults include **NVDA+Windows+i** or **⡊+space**). While active:

- **HUC8:** type the **Unicode HUC8 braille pattern** for the character; the add-on waits until the sequence is **valid and complete**, then inserts the character (many symbols need **about four** cells; some need **more**—see the [HUC](https://danielmayr.at/huc/) site). Works for **emoji** and other supported code points.
- **Numeric bases:** after the **escape** sign, send **⠭** or **⠓** (hex), **⠙** (decimal), **⠕** (octal), **⠃** (binary), type digits, then **Space**.
- **Abbreviations:** stored with the add-on’s **advanced input dictionary** (one entry per abbreviation and table); if you add the same abbreviation twice, the new text **replaces** the old one. Expand with **abbreviation + Space**.

**HUC6 input** is not implemented.

| Character | HUC8 | Hex | Decimal | Octal | Binary |
|-----------|------|-----|---------|-------|--------|
| 👍 thumbs up | ⣭⢤⡙ | 1F44D | 128077 | 372115 | 11111010001001101 |
| 😀 grinning face | ⣭⡤⣺ | 1F600 | 128512 | 373000 | 11111011000000000 |
| 🍑 peach | ⣭⠤⠕ | 1F351 | 127825 | 371521 | 11111001101010001 |
| 🌊 water wave | ⣭⠤⠺ | 1F30A | 127754 | 371412 | 11111001100001010 |

### Current character information

Uses the character at the **review cursor** (navigator). The **braille cells** in the report are produced with your **current output translation table** (the same Liblouis chain used for on-screen braille, including table dictionaries when they apply)—not the separate **input** table. One press: short summary; double press: **browseable** block.

**Example** (“.”):

```text
.: 0x2e, 46, 0o56, 0b101110
dot (FULL STOP [Po])
⠲ (256)
⣥⣺⢃, ⠿⠺⠏⠔
```

### One-handed mode

Compose a cell in several steps—useful if you type with one hand. In **Braille Essentials settings**, the three methods appear in this order: **Fill a cell in two stages using one side only**, **Fill a cell in two stages using both sides**, **Fill a cell dots by dots**. Toggle one-handed mode with **NVDA+Windows+h** (often **⡂+space** on supported displays). If the stored method is unknown, the add-on speaks **unsupported** and clears any partly typed cell.

#### One side only (two steps on one bank; Space = empty half)

First step: dots **1–2–3–7**. Second step: **4–5–6–8**. **Space** means “this half is empty”. **Space twice** gives a completely empty cell.

- **⠛:** **1–2** then **1–2**, or **4–5** then **4–5**
- **⠃:** **1–2** then **Space**, or **4–5** then **Space**
- **⠘:** **Space** then **1–2**, or **Space** then **4–5**

#### Both sides (left bank, then right bank)

Type **left** bank dots, then **right** bank. If one side is empty, press the **same** dots twice, or enter the non-empty side in **two** steps.

- **⠛:** dots **1–2**, then **4–5**
- **⠃:** **1–2** then **1–2**, or **1** then **2**
- **⠘:** **4–5** then **4–5**, or **4** then **5**

#### Dot by dot (toggle)

Each key press **flips** a dot. Press **Space** when the cell is the one you want.

**⠛** can be built as: **1–2** then **4–5** then Space; or **1–2–3**, dot **3** again to correct, then **4–5**, Space; or **1**, then **2–4–5**, Space; and other paths.

### Speech History Mode

**Do not confuse this with NVDA’s shortcut for toggling braille mode (`NVDA+Alt+t`).**

In current NVDA (see **Commands Quick Reference → Braille** and **Input help**):

- **`NVDA+Alt+t`** — **Toggle braille mode** (shortcut documented since **NVDA 2024.2**, which added **display speech output** mode: braille can mirror what NVDA speaks). NVDA cycles its braille modes, including **display** vs **speech output**. That is still **not** Braille Essentials’ separate **speech history list** and **routing** workflow.

**What Braille Essentials does instead**

While **Speech History Mode** is **on**, the add-on **records what NVDA speaks** as plain-text lines you can browse, uses **line scroll** on the display to move through that list, and **switches the braille line** to show those lines instead of the usual focus or review text. Turning the mode **off** returns braille to normal and refreshes the display.

- **Assign a gesture:** the add-on does **not** ship a mandatory desktop shortcut—use **Input gestures → Braille Essentials →** *Turn Braille Essentials speech history mode on or off…* Many display profiles use a **gesture** such as **⡞+space**; use **Gestures for this display…** to see yours.
- **Gesture conflict:** avoid mapping this add-on command to **`NVDA+Alt+t`** unless you mean to **replace** NVDA’s **toggle braille mode** command on that key.
- **While browsing history:** speech is captured as **text only** (no sounds or tones in the list); the **forward/back** line commands move through stored lines when you are in this mode.
- **Limit:** how many lines to keep (the settings panel allows a very high maximum).
- **Number entries:** each line is prefixed with **`#`** and the **entry number** (padded with leading zeros so all numbers use the same width), then **`:`** and the text—for example **`#3:`** or **`#0003:`** depending on your history limit.
- **Speak entries:** optionally read the line aloud when you move in the history.
- **Routing:** key **0** copies the current line; key **`displaySize − 1`** opens **browseable** text; **middle keys** jump by a distance that depends on **left vs right of center** on the display.

### Rotor

The rotor switches **active quick-nav / review category**. Categories include **text navigation**, **selection**, **object / review**, **links** (visited/unvisited), **landmarks**, **headings** (per level), lists, form controls, **tables**, **same/different formatting**, **input/output table lists**, and more.

- **Settings:** enable/disable each category and set **master order**. Only **enabled** items appear when cycling.
- **Which categories appear:** in **browse mode–style** views (many web pages, similar documents, and some app views with quick navigation), the add-on **asks NVDA** whether each rotor type is supported; types that would always fail (for example some **formatting** jumps in certain **Word** views) are **hidden** so you are not stuck on “not supported”.
- **Gestures:** assign **next/previous rotor item** and **next/previous rotor set** in **Input gestures**; display profiles may already bind them.

### Auto scroll

When **auto scroll** is on, the display **advances by itself** on a timer while you stay on the usual braille view. If you switch to another view (for example speech history), auto scroll **pauses** until you return.

- **Delay:** stored **per braille display model**, between about **0.2 and 42 seconds** between steps (default about **3 seconds**).
- **Faster / slower keys:** each press changes the delay by a configurable step (roughly **25 ms** up to **7 s** per step, depending on settings).
- **Adjust to content:** the delay can shorten or lengthen based on **how much of the current line fits** on your display.
- **Ignore blank lines:** optional skip of empty lines while auto scrolling.
- **Beeps** when turning auto scroll on or off.

### Role labels

When **Use custom role labels** is checked, you can edit **role**, **landmark**, and **positive / negative state** labels per language from this panel (stored with your other Braille Essentials settings). When unchecked, NVDA’s default labels apply.

### Advanced

- **Fix cursor positions:** helps in awkward controls by cleaning up **combining Unicode symbols** next to letters so braille and the routing cursor line up more reliably.
- **Hide dots 7–8:** toggle (assign **Input gestures → Braille Essentials** if you want a shortcut) that **clears dots 7 and 8** from braille cells when NVDA is **not** showing an in-line **text selection** on that line—useful for a flatter view with **contracted** braille (NVDA describes this command as hiding dots 7–8 in contracted output).
- **Refresh when object name changes:** when enabled, a **name-change** event causes the add-on to **refresh braille for the foreground window**—useful when **titles or labels** update often (timers, live counters) so the display does not look stuck.
