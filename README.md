## How Braille Essentials relates to NVDA

Braille Essentials is a fork of Braille Extender (see below). It includes most of the features discussed below and shares common history and code. However, Braile Essentials is designed with more recent NVDA releases in mind, including using NVDA features such as add-on store's add-on update feature and support for document formatting tags provided by NVDA.

From Braille Extender documentation: Braille Extender used to cover a lot of ground that **NVDA did not do yet** in braille. The first public release was **August 2017**, the same week as **NVDA 2017.3**, which is the version that best matches that moment in time.

NVDA’s own **Settings → Braille** (and related panels) have since gained options many people once relied on the add-on for. Braille Essentials still adds extra behavior; check NVDA’s **release notes** if you want the exact wording for each item below.

| From NVDA | Now in NVDA core (summary) |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **2022.3** | **Interrupt speech** when scrolling the braille display. |
| **2024.2** | **`NVDA+Alt+t`** toggles **braille mode**; new **display speech output** mode (braille mirrors what NVDA speaks). |
| **2024.3** | **Unicode normalization** for speech and braille; **custom braille tables** from add-ons and NVDA’s scratchpad folder. Braille Essentials can add its own tables and use tables from other add-ons, not only NVDA’s built-in list. |
| **2024.4** | **Speak character when routing** in text; more **formatting in braille** choices (e.g. tags); **paragraph start** in braille when reading by paragraph; routing fixes. |
| **2025.1** | **Input and output tables** can follow NVDA’s **interface language**; **speak line or paragraph** when using braille **navigation** keys. |
| **2026.1** | **List item count** and **spelling and grammar errors** are reported in braille. |
| **2026.2** | **Braille auto-scroll** added, including setting **scroll rate** in percentage. |

---

## Settings categories (overview)

These match the tabs in **Braille Essentials settings**:

| Category | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| **General** | Speak current line while scrolling, skip blank lines, smart Caps Lock, modifier/volume feedback, two favorite displays and reload, margins, reverse scroll, tab as spaces, terminals (braille follows review), routing cursor behavior, announce character when routing (until NVDA handles it), post-output table, quick launches. |
| **Rotor** | Which rotor items exist and their order. |
| **Auto scroll** | Delays and behavior for automatic braille scrolling. |
| **Speech History Mode** | History length, numbering, optional speech while browsing history. |
| **Document formatting** | How formatting (bold, links, alignment, …) appears in braille, on top of NVDA’s document formatting (see [Detailed topics](#document-formatting)). |
| **Excel** | Show cell values and formulas in braille; optional row or column overview with routing (see [Excel](#excel)). |
| **Object Presentation** | Order of name, state, value, and other fields on the focus line; highlight selection with dots 7/8; progress bar messages on the display. |
| **Braille tables** | Preferred input/output table lists, optional automatic tables on NVDA 2025.1+, shortcut input table, second translation pass, tabs as spaces, **Manage custom braille tables…** (NVDA 2024.3+). |
| **Undefined character representation** | How characters missing from the table appear (dots, numbers, descriptions, HUC, …). |
| **Advanced input mode** | Escape sign and exit-after-one-character (abbreviation dictionary is a separate menu dialog—see [Documentation in NVDA](#documentation-in-nvda)). |
| **One-handed mode** | Enable and choose one of three one-hand input methods. |
| **Role labels** | Custom braille labels for roles, landmarks, and states. |
| **Advanced** | Variation-selector cursor fix; refresh braille when the foreground object’s name changes. |

---

## Detailed topics

### General

- **Say current line while scrolling:** speaks the line when you pan the braille display—**focus**, **review**, **both**, or **off**. On **NVDA 2025.1+**, NVDA can also speak the line when using braille navigation keys; if you hear **double** announcements, turn off NVDA **Braille → Speak when navigating by line or paragraph** or reduce overlap here.
- **Interrupt speech while scrolling:** the add-on’s **Speech interrupt when scrolling on same line** checkbox is **disabled on NVDA 2022.3 and later**; use NVDA **Braille → Interrupt speech while scrolling** instead. On **older NVDA** you can still change the add-on checkbox.
- **Skip blank lines:** when panning by line, empty lines can be skipped.
- **Smart Caps Lock:** when this option is **on** and **Windows Caps Lock** is **on**, letters produced from the **braille keyboard** in an ordinary **text field** are **sent with swapped case** (each **A–Z** becomes the opposite case; other characters are unchanged). This only applies to normal typing, not when you are holding **modifier keys** for shortcuts. Turn it **off** if you want the braille table’s output exactly as translated, regardless of Caps Lock.
- **Modifier / volume feedback:** optional **braille**, **speech**, **both**, or **none** when modifier locks or volume change gestures are used; optional **beeps** with modifiers.
- **Two favorite displays:** pick two saved display names and use the reload gestures to **switch the active braille display** quickly.
- **Right margin:** per active braille display, in cells (up to **80** in your profile; the settings spin control may allow a higher value).
- **Reverse scroll buttons:** swaps which physical key means “scroll back” vs “scroll forward”.
- **Terminals (braille follows review):** when **on**, in a **terminal** (Command Prompt, PowerShell, PuTTY, **Windows Terminal**, and similar) braille **follows the review cursor** and stays aligned with the text you are editing, even when NVDA would usually tie braille to the focused control. When you leave the terminal, normal NVDA behavior returns. Turn **off** if you prefer NVDA’s default. Not available on the secure sign-in screen, or when braille is set to follow **speech output** only.
- **Routing in edit fields:** **normal** passes the key to NVDA; **emulate arrows** sends Home/End or repeated Left/Right so the caret jumps to the braille cell under the router (optional **beeps**). This applies when you are on the usual braille view, the system caret has **focus**, and you are in a **terminal** or **editable text** field.
- **Announce character when routing braille cursor:** when enabled, after **routing** the add-on speaks the **character under the routing cursor** using NVDA’s speech-symbol rules. On **NVDA 2024.4+** this checkbox is **disabled** in favor of NVDA **Braille → Speak character when routing cursor in text** (same idea).
- **Speech interrupt for unknown gestures:** for **braille display** keys with **no assigned command**, controls whether NVDA **stops speech** when you press them. **Checked** (default): unassigned keys interrupt speech like most NVDA keys. **Unchecked**: unassigned keys do **not** cancel speech. Does not apply to braille **typing** (dots/enter), volume keys, modifier emulation, or line scroll when the scroll-interrupt rule above allows speech to continue.
- **Braille keyboard configuration:** shown only when your display profile defines **keyboard layouts** (not all displays).
- **Unicode tools** (assign in **Input gestures**): work on **selected text** on a web page when you have a selection; otherwise on the text at the **review cursor**. Convert plain text ↔ Unicode braille and Unicode braille ↔ dot numbers.
- **Character information** (assign in **Input gestures**): at the review cursor, reports Unicode name, speech symbol, braille cells, and numeric bases; double-press for a browseable block.

### Braille tables

- **Rotation lists:** your **input** and **output** table lists are **names in order, separated by commas**. The **next/previous table** commands move through that order (assign them in **Input gestures** if your display profile does not already). **Custom Braille Essentials tables are not listed here**—choose them only in the custom braille tables dialog (see below).
- **Automatic table row:** On **NVDA 2025.1+**, you can include **automatic** entries; the add-on resolves them with NVDA’s language-based default tables. On older NVDA, **auto** is not supported the same way—use explicit table files.
- **Shortcut input table:** optional separate table used for certain shortcuts.
- **Additional Liblouis output pass:** optional **second output table** applied after the main one (tables from your preferred output list; not inactive custom tables).
- **Tabs as spaces:** show tab characters as a run of spaces; **tab width** is per active display (range **1–42**).
- **Manage custom braille tables…:** opens the custom-tables dialog (see below).

**Table dictionaries** (not in settings tabs)

Three layers work together: **Global** (applies to all tables), **Table** (for the current **output** table), and **Temporary** (short-lived overrides until you restart NVDA). If a dictionary file has errors, that layer is skipped until you fix it.

Open **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Table dictionaries** → **Global dictionary**, **Table dictionary**, or **Temporary dictionary**.

#### Custom braille tables

Braille Essentials can **store and use your own braille tables** when you select them in the manager. They apply to braille **input** and **output** through the add-on (not through **NVDA → Settings → Braille** or the add-on’s table rotation lists).

**Requirement**: Table files must be **`.utb`**, **`.ctb`**, or **`.tbl`** (not helper files such as `.cti` or `.dis`).

**Where to open the manager**

| Location | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Custom braille tables…** | Dedicated dialog (list and all actions). |
| **Braille Essentials settings → Braille tables → Manage custom braille tables…** | Opens the same dialog. |

**What you can do**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Add…** | **Copy from an existing table** or **create an empty table** with a minimal starter rule file. The copy list includes built-in NVDA tables, other add-ons’ tables, and tables already stored by Braille Essentials. Set display name, contracted, and input/output flags in the next dialog. |
| **Remove** | Deletes metadata and the stored `.utb` / `.ctb` / `.tbl` file after confirmation. |
| **Edit…** | Opens the table file in your default editor (under the user storage folder below). |
| **Properties…** | Change display name, contracted, and whether the table is used for **input** and/or **output**. |

To **clone a custom table you already manage**, use **Add… → Copy from an existing table** and pick it from the list (same display name as in the custom-tables list).

**Add dialog**

- Choose **Copy from an existing table** (built-in, other add-ons, or your own custom tables) or **Create an empty table**.
- **Copy** keeps the source file extension (`.utb`, `.ctb`, or `.tbl`).
- **Create empty** writes a minimal starter file as **`.utb`**, or **`.ctb`** if you mark the table **contracted** in the properties step.

**Choosing which custom table to use**

At the top of the custom braille tables dialog:

| Control | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Active custom input table** | **None** (default) uses your normal NVDA input table. Pick a custom table to use it for braille input. |
| **Active custom output table** | **None** uses your normal NVDA output table. Pick a custom table to use it for braille translation. |

Only the table(s) you select here are active. They **do not** appear in **NVDA → Settings → Braille** or in Braille Essentials’s table rotation lists, so NVDA can still start normally if the add-on is not loaded.

Press **OK** to apply your choice. To stop using custom tables, set both lists to **None** (files are kept). To delete tables permanently, use **Remove** in the manager.

**Storage**

Table files and a small settings file are saved in your **NVDA user configuration folder** ( **NVDA menu → Preferences → General → Open NVDA user configuration directory** ), under **brailleEssentials\customBrailleTables\**.

After you add, remove, or change tables, braille **updates immediately**.

**Using custom tables day to day**

1. Add the table (**Add… → Copy from an existing table**, or **create an empty table**).
2. In **Properties**, allow it for **input** and/or **output** (capabilities of the table file).
3. Set **Active custom input table** and/or **Active custom output table** to that table (or leave **None** for that direction).
4. Press **OK**. New tables are selected automatically for the directions you enabled when you add them.

**If you turn the add-on off**

Your custom table choice is kept in Braille Essentials’s own settings so NVDA’s braille settings stay on a safe built-in table. When you enable the add-on again, your custom selection comes back.

**Tables from other add-ons (NVDA 2024.3+)**

You do **not** need to copy a table into Braille Essentials’s folder. Tables from another add-on (for example **Experimental braille tables**) or NVDA’s scratchpad work like built-in tables: add them to your **rotation lists**, switch to them with the table commands, or use them as the **additional output pass**. On **NVDA 2024.1–2024.2**, only NVDA’s built-in tables are supported.

**If a table file is missing**

The add-on falls back to a safe table where it can and clears broken entries from your lists so braille keeps working.

### Document formatting

Braille Essentials does **not** replace NVDA’s **Document formatting** dialog. The **Document formatting** settings tab adds a separate braille layer:

- **Per category:** each row is **Follow NVDA document formatting**, **enabled**, or **disabled** (see the panel description at the top of the tab).
- **Plain text mode** — disable all text formatting from this layer.
- **Process formatting line per line** — build braille one line at a time.
- **Report rows** — one combo per category (font attributes, emphasis, alignment, colors, links, headings, lists, tables, cell coordinates, spelling/grammar, and others listed on the tab).
- **Level of items in a nested list** — show list nesting level in braille.
- **Methods…** — per-attribute display (nothing, hand over to the table, dots 7/8, tags, line padding for alignments, etc.).
- **Tags…** — start/end tag strings used by tag-style methods.

On **NVDA 2024.4+**, NVDA also has global braille formatting options; this tab remains the add-on’s row-by-row control.

### Object presentation

This tab changes what appears on the braille display when NVDA shows **one object at a time**—the summary line for the focused control (button, link, table cell, and similar). It does **not** change how NVDA **speaks** object information; use NVDA **Settings → Object presentation** for speech options.

#### Order properties…

Open **Object presentation → Order Properties…** to set **which parts come first**, reading left to right on the display. Parts with no content for the current object are skipped.

You can reorder these fields (labels match the dialog):

- **name**, **value**, **state**, **role text** (type of control, for example heading level)
- **description**, **keyboard shortcut**, **position info** (shown as `3/10` in braille, not “3 of 10”)
- **position info level** (outline level, `lv 2`)
- **current labels** (for example “current page” on the web)
- **place-holder**, **cell coordinates text**

**Reset to the default NVDA order** — same order as NVDA without this add-on (name, then value, state, role text, and so on).

**Reset to the default add-on order** — puts **state** and **cell coordinates** before **name** (default for new profiles).

**What still follows NVDA**

- **Description**, **keyboard shortcut**, and **position** only appear if the matching options are enabled in NVDA **Settings → Object presentation**.
- **Cell coordinates** also follow **Braille Essentials → Document formatting → Cell coordinates**.

Row and column headers from the application may still be added after the main summary when available.

#### Selected elements

**Selected elements** controls how a **selected** item is marked on that object summary line:

| Choice | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **nothing** | No extra marking from this add-on |
| **dot 7**, **dot 8**, or **dots 7 and 8** | Adds dots 7 and/or 8 to the braille cells that spell the object’s **name** |
| **tags** | Does not draw tag characters on the name; only affects state text as below |

When the choice is not **nothing** and the object has a **name**, the words **selected** and **selectable** are omitted from the **state** text so you are not told “selected” twice. Highlighting **inside running text** still follows NVDA’s own **show selection** setting.

#### Progress bar output using braille messages

When a progress bar’s value changes, the add-on can show a **short message on the braille display** (speech is unchanged—use NVDA **Settings → Object presentation → Progress bar updates** for speech):

| Option | What you see |
|--------|----------------|
| **disabled (original behavior)** | No extra braille messages from this add-on |
| **enabled, show raw value** | The bar’s value text (default) |
| **enabled, show a progress bar using ⣿** | A row of filled cells across the display, length based on the percentage |

#### Report background progress bars

The three choices (**Follow NVDA document formatting**, **enabled**, **disabled**) use the same wording as on the Document formatting tab, but here they only decide **which windows’** progress bars can trigger the braille messages above:

| Choice | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Follow NVDA document formatting** | Follows NVDA **Report background progress bars**, or shows bars in the window you are working in |
| **enabled** | Progress bars in background and foreground windows |
| **disabled** | Only progress bars in the **foreground** window |

### Undefined character representation

Characters **not defined** in the active output table (including many **emoji**) use the chosen **method**: **use braille table behavior**, full **1–8** or **1–6** dot cell, **empty**, custom **dot pattern** (for example `6-123456`), **question mark**, custom **sign** (for example `??`), **hex** (table style, **HUC8**, **HUC6**), **decimal**, **octal**, **binary**.

**Descriptions:** optional character **description**, **extended** description, **full extended**, optional **size** line, optional **Unicode data** as a last resort, and an **exclude** list (character codes or ranges) so description is skipped for ranges you find noisy.

**Precedence:** table rules and **table dictionaries** take priority over descriptions; descriptions take priority over the generic undefined pattern.

More on **HUC**: [danielmayr.at/huc](https://danielmayr.at/huc/)

### Advanced input mode

**Settings tab:** escape sign for numeric/Unicode input and **exit after one character**.

**Menu dialog:** **NVDA menu → Braille Essentials → Advanced input mode dictionary…** — abbreviation entries per input table (separate from table dictionaries).

Toggle **advanced input** (defaults include **NVDA+Windows+i** or **⡊+space**). While active:

- **HUC8:** type the **Unicode HUC8 braille pattern** for the character; the add-on waits until the sequence is **valid and complete**, then inserts the character (many symbols need **about four** cells; some need **more**—see the [HUC](https://danielmayr.at/huc/) site). Works for **emoji** and other supported code points.
- **Numeric bases:** after the **escape** sign, send **⠭** or **⠓** (hex), **⠙** (decimal), **⠕** (octal), **⠃** (binary), type digits, then **Space**.
- **Abbreviations:** stored in the **advanced input mode dictionary** (menu dialog above; one entry per abbreviation and table). If you add the same abbreviation twice, the new text **replaces** the old one. Expand with **abbreviation + Space**.

**HUC6 input** is not implemented.

| Character | HUC8 | Hex | Decimal | Octal | Binary |
|-----------|------|-----|---------|-------|--------|

### One-handed mode

Compose a cell in several steps—useful if you type with one hand. In **Braille Essentials settings**, the three methods appear in this order: **Fill a cell in two stages using one side only**, **Fill a cell in two stages using both sides**, **Fill a cell dots by dots**. Toggle one-handed mode with **NVDA+Windows+h** (often **⡂+space** on supported displays). If the stored method is unknown, the add-on speaks **unsupported** and clears any partly typed cell.

#### One side only (two steps on one bank; Space = empty half)

First step: dots **1–2–3–7**. Second step: **4–5–6–8**. **Space** means “this half is empty”. **Space twice** gives a completely empty cell.

- **⠛:** **1–2** then **1–2**, or **4–5** then **4–5**
- **⠃:** **1–2** then **Space**, or **4–5** then **Space**
- **⠘:** **Space** then **1–2**, or **Space** then **4–5**

#### Both sides (left bank, then right bank)

Type **left** bank dots, then **right** bank. If one side is empty, press the **same** dots twice, or enter the non-empty side in **two** steps.

- **⠛:** dots **1–2**, then **4–5**
- **⠃:** **1–2** then **1–2**, or **1** then **2**
- **⠘:** **4–5** then **4–5**, or **4** then **5**

#### Dot by dot (toggle)

Each key press **flips** a dot. Press **Space** when the cell is the one you want.

**⠛** can be built as: **1–2** then **4–5** then Space; or **1–2–3**, dot **3** again to correct, then **4–5**, Space; or **1**, then **2–4–5**, Space; and other paths.

### Speech History Mode

**Do not confuse this with NVDA’s shortcut for toggling braille mode (`NVDA+Alt+t`).**

In current NVDA (see **Commands Quick Reference → Braille** and **Input help**):

- **`NVDA+Alt+t`** — **Toggle braille mode** (shortcut documented since **NVDA 2024.2**, which added **display speech output** mode: braille can mirror what NVDA speaks). NVDA cycles its braille modes, including **display** vs **speech output**. That is still **not** Braille Essentials’s separate **speech history list** and **routing** workflow.

**What Braille Essentials does instead**

While **Speech History Mode** is **on**, the add-on **records what NVDA speaks** as plain-text lines you can browse, uses **line scroll** on the display to move through that list, and **switches the braille line** to show those lines instead of the usual focus or review text. Turning the mode **off** returns braille to normal and refreshes the display.

- **Assign a gesture:** the add-on does **not** ship a mandatory desktop shortcut—use **Input gestures → Braille Essentials →** *Turn Braille Essentials speech history mode on or off…* Many display profiles use a **gesture** such as **⡞+space**; use **Gestures for this display…** to see yours.
- **Gesture conflict:** avoid mapping this add-on command to **`NVDA+Alt+t`** unless you mean to **replace** NVDA’s **toggle braille mode** command on that key.
- **While browsing history:** speech is captured as **text only** (no sounds or tones in the list); the **forward/back** line commands move through stored lines when you are in this mode.
- **Limit:** how many lines to keep (the settings panel allows a very high maximum).
- **Number entries:** each line is prefixed with **`#`** and the **entry number** (padded with leading zeros so all numbers use the same width), then **`:`** and the text—for example **`#3:`** or **`#0003:`** depending on your history limit.
- **Speak entries:** optionally read the line aloud when you move in the history.
- **Routing:** the **leftmost** routing key copies the current line; the **rightmost** opens **browseable** text; **middle keys** jump forward or backward in the list depending on which side of the display you press.

### Rotor

The rotor switches **active quick-nav / review category**. Categories include **text navigation**, **selection**, **object / review**, **links** (visited/unvisited), **landmarks**, **headings** (per level), lists, form controls, **tables**, **same/different formatting**, **input/output table lists**, and more.

- **Settings:** enable/disable each category and set **master order**. Only **enabled** items appear when cycling.
- **Which categories appear:** in **browse mode–style** views (many web pages, similar documents, and some app views with quick navigation), the add-on **asks NVDA** whether each rotor type is supported; types that would always fail (for example some **formatting** jumps in certain **Word** views) are **hidden** so you are not stuck on “not supported”.
- **Gestures:** assign **next/previous rotor item** and **next/previous rotor set** in **Input gestures**; display profiles may already bind them.

### Auto scroll

When **auto scroll** is on, the display **advances by itself** on a timer while you stay on the usual braille view. If you switch to another view (for example speech history), auto scroll **pauses** until you return.

- **Delay:** stored **per braille display model**, between about **0.2 and 42 seconds** between steps (default about **3 seconds**).
- **Faster / slower keys:** each press changes the delay by a configurable step (roughly **25 ms** up to **7 s** per step, depending on settings).
- **Adjust to content:** the delay can shorten or lengthen based on **how much of the current line fits** on your display.
- **Ignore blank lines:** optional skip of empty lines while auto scrolling.
- **Beeps** when turning auto scroll on or off.

### Role labels

When **Use custom role labels** is checked, you can edit **role**, **landmark**, and **positive / negative state** labels per language from this panel (stored with your other Braille Essentials settings). When unchecked, NVDA’s default labels apply.

### Advanced

- **Avoid cursor positions issues with some characters such as variation selectors** — improves braille alignment when certain Unicode characters (variation selectors) are next to letters.
- **Force the refresh of braille region related to foreground object** — updates the display when the focused item’s **name** changes often (timers, live counters, changing window titles).

---

## Gestures and profiles

- **Keyboard:** listed under **Input gestures → Category: Braille Essentials**. **Gestures for this display…** shows bindings for your **current** braille display profile (including display-specific keys when a profile exists).
- **Braille display:** some displays ship with a predefined gesture map. If yours does not, assign commands in **Input gestures** like any other NVDA command.
- **Not in settings tabs** (menu or Input gestures only): hide/show dots 7–8, lock braille keyboard, lock modifier keys, quick launches, table dictionaries, advanced input dictionary, custom braille tables manager, table overview, Unicode tools, character information, and others—search **Braille Essentials** in Input gestures to browse them.
